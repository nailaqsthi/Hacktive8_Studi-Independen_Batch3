    "### Introduction\n",
    "Many sales occur with a nonsensically small dollar amount: $0 most commonly. These sales are actually transfers of deeds between parties: for example, parents transferring ownership to their home to a child after moving out for retirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset uses the financial definition of a building/building unit, for tax purposes. In case a single entity owns the building in question, a sale covers the value of the entire building. In case a building is owned piecemeal by its residents (a condominium), a sale refers to a single apartment (or group of apartments) owned by some individual.\n",
    "#### Source Data :\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/new-york-city/nyc-property-sales\n",
    "- BOROUGH: A digit code for the borough the property is located in; in order these are Manhattan (1), Bronx (2), Brooklyn (3), Queens (4), and Staten Island (5).\n",
    "- BLOCK; LOT: The combination of borough, block, and lot forms a unique key for property in New York City. Commonly called a BBL.\n",
    "- BUILDING CLASS AT PRESENT and BUILDING CLASS AT TIME OF SALE: The type of building at various points in time. See the glossary linked to below.\n",
